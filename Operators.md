# Operators

Regular functions are defined as:

    add a b = ...
    
    add 2 2

To create an infix operator:

    a + b = ...
    
    2 + 2


The compiler will recognise the `+` symbol as an operator symbol. Any symbol composed of non alphabetic characters and the underscore are considered operator symbols.

- **Q**: In this case how will you define a more complex macro like `if _ then _ else _`?

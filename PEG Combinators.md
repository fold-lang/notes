# PEG Combinators

Parsing combinators are implemented in popular functional libraries for flexible and efficient monadic parsing. _Parsing expression grammar_ is a formal model used to describe languages as a set of string-parsing rules. In this post I will describe a lightweight notation for monadic parsing combinators based on PEG. This notation will be used for macros in Fold.
